## Next:
- ask deletion/download of vuser myo data before deleting account?

## General
- cycle data myo and sds data volumes?
- verify that sensitive infos do not end up in docker images thru env
- define a log file for each process/app, and make it accessible to UI; on each action started from UI, catch respective log and display
- integrate python converter within streamlit container instead of seiscomp? to avoid double python install
- catch all errors and warning and add a report bug form

## Nginx

## Seiscomp
- send alert to user if myo to mseed conversion failure?
- enforce env variable validity?
- make lighter image removing unused fetaures?

## Mariadb
- check if init mounted db overrides existing one at container restart/rebuild

## Vsftpd
- clean up vsftpd conf file
- check dotenv variable validity
- allow special account to be able to manage  myo/mseed_segments/archive?

## Streamlit
- possibility to download and upload stationXML directly
- handle XML validity with obspy?
- interactive xml edit system ? using st df data editor
- check/debug illegal resp error on some datalog choices
- revert to offline NRL
- add auto processings
- add explicit option to merge traces in MSEED?
- could add an obspy section plot tab, for seeing an event on different sections at the same time
- add a dashboard as home page where stations are listed, with a green/yellow/red stoplight depending on last data reception (channels details with hover?)  
- could propose large trace as an image (pyplot), and small trace as an interactive plotly object
- watchout margin 120 can give error with resize using cmd +/- (wrap in error catch)
- mod trace colors
- plot day with plotly?
- put progress bars instead of spinner on remove resp when long?
- should test timeline when avauilability differs by channel

## End
- documentation/readme
- error handling
- freeze versions


## Custom sensor and digitizer in stationXML
- for digitizer, user can choose gain, range?, input units (volts), output units (counts)
