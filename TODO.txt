## General
- cycle data myo and sds data volumes?
- verify that sensitive infos do not end up in docker images through env
- create a log file for each backend process? make it accessible to UI? on each action started from UI, could catch respective log and display.
- integrate python converter within streamlit container instead of seiscomp? would avoid double python install
- add optional bug report form triggered on error catch

## Seiscomp
- send alert to user if myo to mseed conversion failure?
- make lighter docker image removing unused features?

## Mariadb
- check if init mounted db overrides existing one at container restart/rebuild

## Vsftpd
- clean up vsftpd conf file
- check dotenv variable validity
- allow special account to be able to manage myo/mseed_segments/archive?

## Streamlit
- possibility to upload stationXML directly?
- handle XML validity with obspy?
- check/debug illegal resp error on some datalog choices
- revert to offline NRL?
- prevent zoom on min/max plots?
- watchout margin 120 can give error with resize using cmd +/- (wrap in error catch)
- mod trace colors
- put progress bars instead of spinner on remove resp when long?
- test timeline when availability differs by channel
- add possibility of lowpass or highpass filter only
- ask deletion/download of vuser myo data before deleting account?
- check diff between ? status and black light status
